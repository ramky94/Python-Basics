1.Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a
multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included). The numbers obtained should be printed
in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
2.Write a Python program to accept the user's first and last name and then getting them
printed in the the reverse order with a space between first name and last name.
3.Write a Python program to find the volume of a sphere with diameter 12 cm.
Formula: V=4/3 * π * r

4.Write a Python program to reverse a word after accepting the input from the user.
Input word: ineuron
Output: norueni
5.Write a Python Program to implement your own myreduce() function which works exactly like Python's built-in function reduce()
6.Write a Python program to implement your own myfilter() function which works exactly like Python's built-in function filter()
7.Implement List comprehensions to produce the following lists. Write List comprehensions to produce the following Lists
['A', 'C', 'A', 'D', 'G', 'I', ’L’, ‘ D’] ['x', 'xx', 'xxx', 'xxxx', 'y', 'yy', 'yyy', 'yyyy', 'z', 'zz', 'zzz', 'zzzz']
['x', 'y', 'z', 'xx', 'yy', 'zz', 'xx', 'yy', 'zz', 'xxxx', 'yyyy', 'zzzz']
[[2], [3], [4], [3], [4], [5], [4], [5], [6]] [[2, 3, 4, 5], [3, 4, 5, 6], [4, 5, 6, 7], [5, 6, 7, 8]]
[(1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)]
8.Write a Python Program(with class concepts) to find the area of the triangle using the below
formula.area = (s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c)) ** 0.5
9.Write a function filter_long_words() that takes a list of words and an integer n and returns
the list of words that are longer than n.
10.Write a Python program using function concept that maps list of words into a list of integers
representing the lengths of the corresponding words.
Hint: If a list [ ab,cde,erty] is passed on to the python function output should come as [2,3,4]
Here 2,3 and 4 are the lengths of the words in the list.
11.Write a Python function which takes a character (i.e. a string of length 1) and returns True if
it is a vowel, False otherwise.
